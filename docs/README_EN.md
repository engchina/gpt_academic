# Installation
## Method 1: Directly running (Windows, Linux or MacOS) 

1. Download the project
>>>>>>> upstream/master
```sh
git clone https://github.com/binary-husky/chatgpt_academic.git
cd chatgpt_academic
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
2. Configure API_KEY and proxy settings


In `config.py`, configure the overseas Proxy and OpenAI API KEY as follows:
```
1. If you are in China, you need to set up an overseas proxy to use the OpenAI API smoothly. Please read config.py carefully for setup details (1. Modify USE_PROXY to True; 2. Modify proxies according to the instructions).
2. Configure the OpenAI API KEY. You need to register and obtain an API KEY on the OpenAI website. Once you get the API KEY, you can configure it in the config.py file.
3. Issues related to proxy networks (network timeouts, proxy failures) are summarized at https://github.com/binary-husky/chatgpt_academic/issues/1
```
(P.S. When the program runs, it will first check whether there is a private configuration file named `config_private.py` and use the same-name configuration in `config.py` to overwrite it. Therefore, if you can understand our configuration reading logic, we strongly recommend that you create a new configuration file named `config_private.py` next to `config.py` and transfer (copy) the configuration in `config.py` to` config_private.py`. `config_private.py` is not controlled by git and can make your privacy information more secure.))


3. Install dependencies
```sh
# (Option One) Recommended
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt   

# (Option Two) If you use anaconda, the steps are similar:
# (Option Two.1) conda create -n gptac_venv python=3.11
# (Option Two.2) conda activate gptac_venv
# (Option Two.3) python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

# Note: Use official pip source or Ali pip source. Other pip sources (such as some university pips) may have problems, and temporary replacement methods are as follows: 
# python -m pip install -r requirements.txt -i https://mirrors.aliyun.com/pypi/simple/
```

If you need to support Tsinghua ChatGLM, you need to install more dependencies (if you are not familiar with python or your computer configuration is not good, we recommend not to try):
```sh
python -m pip install -r request_llm/requirements_chatglm.txt
```

4. Run
```sh
python main.py
```

5. Test function plugins
```
- Test Python project analysis
    In the input area, enter `./crazy_functions/test_project/python/dqn`, and then click "Analyze the entire Python project"

## Customizing Convenient Buttons (Customizing Academic Shortcuts)
Open `core_functional.py` with any text editor and add an item as follows, then restart the program (if the button has been successfully added and visible, both the prefix and suffix support hot modification without the need to restart the program to take effect). For example:
```
"Super English to Chinese translation": {
    # Prefix, which will be added before your input. For example, to describe your requirements, such as translation, code interpretation, polishing, etc.
    "Prefix": "Please translate the following content into Chinese and use a markdown table to interpret the proprietary terms in the text one by one:\n\n", 

    # Suffix, which will be added after your input. For example, combined with the prefix, you can put your input content in quotes.
=======
2. Configure the API_KEY

Configure the API KEY in `config.py`, [special network environment settings](https://github.com/binary-husky/gpt_academic/issues/1).

(P.S. When the program is running, it will first check if there is a private configuration file named `config_private.py` and use the configurations in it to override the same configurations in `config.py`. Therefore, if you can understand our configuration reading logic, we strongly recommend that you create a new configuration file named `config_private.py` next to `config.py` and transfer (copy) the configurations in `config.py` to `config_private.py`. `config_private.py` is not controlled by git and can make your private information more secure. P.S. The project also supports configuring most options through `environment variables`. Please refer to the format of `docker-compose` file when writing. Reading priority: `environment variables` > `config_private.py` > `config.py`)


3. Install the dependencies
```sh
# (Option I: If familiar with python) (python version 3.9 or above, the newer the better), note: use official pip source or Ali pip source, temporary switching method: python -m pip install -r requirements.txt -i https://mirrors.aliyun.com/pypi/simple/
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

# (Option II: If not familiar with python) Use anaconda, the steps are similar (https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1rc411W7Dr):
conda create -n gptac_venv python=3.11    # create anaconda environment
conda activate gptac_venv                 # activate anaconda environment
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt # this step is the same as pip installation
```

<details><summary>If you need to support Tsinghua ChatGLM/Fudan MOSS as a backend, click to expand</summary>
<p>

[Optional step] If you need to support Tsinghua ChatGLM/Fudan MOSS as a backend, you need to install more dependencies (prerequisites: familiar with Python + used Pytorch + computer configuration is strong enough):
```sh
# [Optional Step I] Support Tsinghua ChatGLM. Tsinghua ChatGLM remarks: if you encounter the "Call ChatGLM fail cannot load ChatGLM parameters" error, refer to this: 1: The default installation above is torch + cpu version, to use cuda, you need to uninstall torch and reinstall torch + cuda; 2: If the model cannot be loaded due to insufficient local configuration, you can modify the model accuracy in request_llm/bridge_chatglm.py, and change AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("THUDM/chatglm-6b", trust_remote_code=True) to AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("THUDM/chatglm-6b-int4", trust_remote_code = True)
python -m pip install -r request_llm/requirements_chatglm.txt 

# [Optional Step II] Support Fudan MOSS
python -m pip install -r request_llm/requirements_moss.txt
git clone https://github.com/OpenLMLab/MOSS.git request_llm/moss  # When executing this line of code, you must be in the root directory of the project

# [Optional Step III] Make sure the AVAIL_LLM_MODELS in the config.py configuration file includes the expected models. Currently supported models are as follows (the jittorllms series only supports the docker solution for the time being):
AVAIL_LLM_MODELS = ["gpt-3.5-turbo", "api2d-gpt-3.5-turbo", "gpt-4", "api2d-gpt-4", "chatglm", "newbing", "moss"] # + ["jittorllms_rwkv", "jittorllms_pangualpha", "jittorllms_llama"]
```

# Advanced Usage
## Custom New Shortcut Buttons / Custom Function Plugins

1. Custom New Shortcut Buttons (Academic Hotkey)
Open `core_functional.py` with any text editor, add an entry as follows and restart the program. (If the button has been successfully added and is visible, the prefix and suffix can be hot-modified without having to restart the program.)
For example,
```
"Super English-to-Chinese": {
    # Prefix, which will be added before your input. For example, used to describe your requests, such as translation, code explanation, polishing, etc.
    "Prefix": "Please translate the following content into Chinese and then use a markdown table to explain the proprietary terms that appear in the text：\n\n", 
    
    # Suffix, which is added after your input. For example, with the prefix, your input content can be surrounded by quotes.
>>>>>>> upstream/master
    "Suffix": "",
},
```

2. Custom Function Plugins

Write powerful function plugins to perform any task you can think of, even those you cannot think of.
The difficulty of plugin writing and debugging in this project is very low. As long as you have a certain knowledge of Python, you can implement your own plug-in functions based on the template we provide.
For details, please refer to the [Function Plugin Guide](https://github.com/binary-husky/chatgpt_academic/wiki/%E5%87%BD%E6%95%B0%E6%8F%92%E4%BB%B6%E6%8C%87%E5%8D%97).

# Latest Update
## New Feature Dynamics
1. Conversation saving function. Call `Save current conversation` in the function plugin area to save the current conversation as a readable and recoverable HTML file. In addition, call `Load conversation history archive` in the function plugin area (dropdown menu) to restore previous sessions. Tip: Clicking `Load conversation history archive` without specifying a file will display the cached history of HTML archives, and clicking `Delete all local conversation history` will delete all HTML archive caches.
